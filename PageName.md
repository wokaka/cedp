Utilizing Fault Injection for High Coverage Software Testing

One important goal of software testing is reducing the likelihood of software failures in production systems. Code coverage is one common metric used to evaluate this likelihood. Achieving a high code coverage requires large engineering efforts. A cost for writing test cases goes higher as the achieved coverage goes close to 100%. As a result, even software widely used for a long period of time (e.g., Unix commands [#](#.md) and Linux kernel [#](#.md)) have code coverage far less than 100% (e.g., 60-80%). It is more  difficult to write high coverage test cases for complex software and software changing frequently (e.g., web servlets).
Difficulty of writing high coverage test cases is due to: (i) Many lines of codes exist for uncommon control flow paths. For example, a code written to handle an error case can only execute when this error occurs. If this error occurs only when the system is overloaded, a test case shall emulate this overloaded scenario to cover this uncovered code. (ii) In complex software integrating multiple software modules,
